M45,Amend: Request to move 30 minutes on Friday from NPC recommendations to Consent Agenda
M47,"Point of Order: 
First, the NPC does not have the authority to remove Kara H. or any candidate from the ballot. The convention is credentialed and seated and the NPC’s authority as executive board between conventions has expired per the constitution and bylaws. Moreover, the NPC statement from this afternoon fails to cite any part of DSA’s Constitution, Bylaws, or any other rule to justify their decision. Just as the NPC withdrew its late constitutional and bylaws amendments, they should withdraw their decision and statement for non-conformance with our rules. 

Second, the unilateral action by the NPC violates Kara H’s right to reply under Resolution 33 (2017). While exceptional circumstances can demand exceptional action, the rights of our members are inalienable. The NPC states they wish to protect the integrity of R33 and promise a R33-compliant process but have started by violating the seven-day notice requirement in the resolution itself. Disciplinary action, such as a bar from office, cannot be taken until that period has elapsed, per R33. 

Third, the NPC is conflicted. The statement barring Kara H. is signed by incumbent members of the NPC, who have a clear conflict of interest in barring candidates from the ballot. A more appropriate committee to consider this action would be the Elections and Credentials Committee. It is my understanding that the E&C Committee was simply CC’ed on the NPCs decision by fiat. This indicates that they were not consulted in this matter and is highly inappropriate for a convention of delegates. 

Finally in the interest of the health and welfare of this convention and socialist camaraderie I request the NPC apologize for the confusion caused by their words and deeds. For the reasons above, I move to vacate the decision of the NPC, and direct the Elections and Credentials Committee to restore Kara H. to the NPC ballot. I request that this motion be heard before the order of business is voted on by the delegates."
